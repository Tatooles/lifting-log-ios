## App Privacy Worksheet

### Data Not Linked to an Account

Local workout data can remain only on the user's device when the user is signed out. This includes exercises, sets, workout sessions, notes, settings, and workout history stored locally by the app.

### Data Linked to an Account

When a user signs in, Lifting Log uses Clerk for authentication and Convex for account-scoped sync. Account-linked data can include:

- Email address or Apple private relay email used for authentication.
- Name, display name, and any Clerk profile metadata if enabled or provided.
- Authentication identifiers and session data processed by Clerk.
- Synced exercises, workout sessions, logged exercises, logged sets, and user settings stored in Convex.

### Tracking

Lifting Log does not use third-party advertising, cross-app tracking, or product analytics in the v1 release.

### Diagnostics

Apple, Clerk, Convex, Vercel, and platform providers may process standard service diagnostics needed to operate, secure, and troubleshoot their services. Lifting Log does not add a custom analytics SDK in v1.
